- Use Shadcn UI from `@zto/ui/components/`
- Use zustand for state manage
- Use pnpm
- Use `lucide-react` for Icons

- Component use props instead of destructuring it directly
- Don't destructuring parameters directly in the function, destructure the parameters inside the function body instead.

- Interface Definition: Define all interfaces outside of function bodies. This promotes reusability and clarity by keeping type definitions separate from implementation logic.
- Interface Naming: Use descriptive names for interfaces that clearly convey their purpose and usage.
- Interface Location: Place interface definitions in a dedicated types.ts file or at the top of the file where they are used, depending on the project's organization and scale.
- Destructuring: Avoid destructuring props directly in the function signature. Instead, destructure them inside the function body to enhance readability and maintainability.
